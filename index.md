## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

LAB 2, part 1
* This lab was fun because it was a lab that I could fully understand as it was 
really easy looking back at it. Me and my partner had to declare a string variable 
and then name it. After that, we had to print out a statement. 

LAB 4, part 1
* This lab was fun since my partner was able to teach me a couple of small things 
like shortcuts that I can implement to make me write the code faster.
I liked this lab because it was a program that would convert any measurement of 
ML into cups, tsp, tbsp, and oz. The code that I wrote was correct and it gave me the 
correct output which motivated me.

LAB 12, part 1 
* I and my partner are currently working on this lab. Me and my partner finished 
the main TODO's and are now working on the unittest. I enjoyed this lab because we 
got to use the GrahicsMagick library for the gifs to work. This assignment was semi 
challenging for me but my partner was able to help me.
